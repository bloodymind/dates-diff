## Setup

### 1. Get the source code

Just clone the project(#branches):

```sh
$ git clone -b master https://github.com/bloodymind/dates-diff.git my-app
$ cd my-app
```

You will probably want to remove git history and start building a new project:

```sh
$ rm -rf .git
$ git init
```

### 2. Install dependencies

We assume you have already Nodejs et NPM already installed! latest version are better, always better :)

```sh
$ npm install
```

### 3. Run the app

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

It will start the development server with on PORT 3000 by default

> [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) â€” Development server<br>

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in browser and start developing.
